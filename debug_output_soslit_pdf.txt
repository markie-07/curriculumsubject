=== CLEANED MAIN TEXT ===
 
1. Scientific 
measurement 
 
1. accuracy, precision, and appropriate use of 
standard units of measurement are 
fundamental to Chemistry; 
 
 
1. explain the difference between mass, volume, and 
density of a solid using the correct and appropriate 
units; 
2. investigate the density of commonly used solids using 
laboratory equipment, including writing a scientific 
report; 
3. explain that accuracy and precision are important to 
assess the quality of experimental results; 
4. identify sources of error and propose improvements to 
enhance measurement reliability;   
5. apply scientific notation and explain how to determine 
the proper number of significant figures in 
calculations;

2. The Quantum 
Theory and the 
electronic 
structure of 
atoms 
 
 
2. the contributions of Planck, Bohr, and 
Schrödinger helped in the development of 
Quantum Theory, which explains the 
behavior of subatomic particle; 
 
3. electrons of elements are arranged 
according to different energy levels, 
subshells, and orbitals based on the 
quantum mechanical model; and 
6. explain how Mendeleev developed the periodic table of 
elements; 
7. create a diagram of the periodic table to illustrate the 
relationship between atomic radius and atomic mass 
of elements across a period and down a group; 
8. draw a model of the discrete energy levels of an atom 
using the ‘spdf’ notation for the orbitals; 
9. write the electronic configuration of common elements 
following the principles of quantum theory; 
10. explain and predict main energy levels, sublevels, and 
orbitals in relation to the electronic configurations of 
elements in periods and groups in the periodic table; 
4. Isotopes 2. isotopes of elements can be both beneficial     
and harmful. 
11. explain that isotopes of an element have the same 
number of protons but a different number of 
neutrons; 
12. use secondary resources to identify natural and 
human-made radioisotopes and their properties in 
terms of the type of radiation emitted and their half-
life; and 
13. use secondary sources to describe the use of 
radioisotopes in medicine.
