# Employee Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of role-based access control for employees in the Curriculum & Subject Management System.

## Changes Made

### 1. Route Protection (`routes/web.php`)
- **Employee Routes**: Protected with `role:employee` middleware
- **Admin Routes**: Protected with `admin` middleware
- **Clear Separation**: Employees can only access curriculum export functionality

```php
// Employee-only routes (limited access)
Route::middleware(['role:employee'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/curriculum_export_tool', [CurriculumExportToolController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/curriculum_export_tool', [CurriculumExportToolController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('/subjects/{subjectId}/export-pdf', [SubjectExportController::class, 'exportPdf']);
    Route::get('/curriculum/{id}/export-pdf', [CurriculumExportToolController::class, 'exportPdf']);
});
```

### 2. Dashboard Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`)
- **Automatic Redirect**: Employees are redirected to curriculum export tool
- **Role-Based Logic**: Different behavior for different user roles

```php
public function index()
{
    $user = Auth::user();
    
    // Redirect employees directly to curriculum export tool
    if ($user->role === 'employee') {
        return redirect()->route('curriculum_export_tool');
    }
    
    // Continue with admin dashboard logic...
}
```

### 3. Navigation Control (`resources/views/partials/sidebar.blade.php`)
- **Conditional Menu**: Different navigation based on user role
- **Employee View**: Shows only Curriculum Export Tool
- **Admin View**: Shows all management tools

```php
@if(Auth::user()->role === 'employee')
    <!-- Employee-only navigation -->
    <a href="{{ route('curriculum_export_tool') }}">Curriculum Export Tool</a>
@else
    <!-- Admin navigation -->
    <!-- All admin menu items -->
@endif
```

### 4. Employee Management (`resources/views/employees.blade.php`)
- **Combined Views**: Single file handles list, create, and edit
- **Route Detection**: Uses `request()->routeIs()` to determine view mode
- **Dynamic Content**: Adapts based on current route

### 5. Middleware Registration (`bootstrap/app.php`)
- **Role Middleware**: Already registered as `role`
- **Admin Middleware**: Already registered as `admin`

```php
$middleware->alias([
    'role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\AdminMiddleware::class,
]);
```

## Access Control Summary

### Employee Access (‚úÖ Allowed)
- `/curriculum_export_tool` - Main export interface
- `/curriculum_export_tool` (POST) - Export processing  
- `/subjects/{id}/export-pdf` - Individual subject PDF export
- `/curriculum/{id}/export-pdf` - Curriculum PDF export
- `/profile` - Profile management
- `/notifications` - Notifications

### Employee Restrictions (‚ùå Blocked)
- `/` - Dashboard (redirected to export tool)
- `/curriculum_builder` - Curriculum Builder
- `/course-builder` - Course Builder
- `/subject_mapping` - Subject Mapping
- `/pre_requisite` - Pre-requisite Configuration
- `/subject_history` - Subject History
- `/equivalency_tool` - Equivalency Tool
- `/grade-setup` - Grade Setup
- `/compliance-validator` - Compliance Validator
- `/employees` - Employee Management

## Security Features

1. **Server-Side Protection**: Routes blocked at middleware level
2. **UI Restrictions**: Navigation hidden for unauthorized features
3. **Automatic Redirects**: Seamless user experience
4. **Role-Based Access**: Leverages existing authentication system

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/Feature/EmployeeAccessTest.php`) to verify:
- Employee can access curriculum export tool
- Employee cannot access admin routes
- Employee is redirected from dashboard
- Admin retains full access

## User Experience

### For Employees:
1. **Login** ‚Üí Automatic redirect to Curriculum Export Tool
2. **Navigation** ‚Üí Only shows Curriculum Export Tool
3. **Focused Interface** ‚Üí Clean, task-specific UI

### For Admins:
1. **Full Access** ‚Üí All management tools available
2. **Employee Management** ‚Üí Can create/edit employee accounts
3. **Complete Dashboard** ‚Üí Statistics and overview

## Benefits

- **üîí Enhanced Security**: Role-based access control
- **üéØ Focused Experience**: Employees see only relevant tools
- **üöÄ Better Performance**: Reduced UI complexity for employees
- **üîß Easy Management**: Admins can manage employee access
- **üì± Clean Interface**: Role-appropriate navigation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Permissions**: More specific permissions within roles
2. **Audit Logging**: Track employee export activities
3. **Export Limits**: Rate limiting for export operations
4. **Department-Based Access**: Sub-role permissions
5. **Session Management**: Enhanced security controls
